# Redux Toolkit App Structure Example

This slimmed-down version of [the Redux Toolkit template for Vite](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-templates/tree/master/packages/vite-template-redux) shows the standard app structure and store setup for Redux Toolkit, TypeScript, and React.

It's used in the ["Redux Essentials" tutorial Part 2](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-2-app-structure) as an embeddable CodeSandbox to help teach Redux app structure.

## Scripts
